# Discord Webhook Integration

## Overview
The Discord webhook integration allows you to send beautiful, formatted log messages from SmartSpawner directly to your Discord server. This provides real-time notifications and an audit trail of all spawner-related activities.

## Features
- âœ… **Rich Embeds**: Beautiful Discord embeds with color coding
- âœ… **Player Avatars**: Show player heads/skins in embed thumbnails
- âœ… **Configurable**: Fully customizable titles, descriptions, colors, and fields
- âœ… **Placeholder Support**: Dynamic content with extensive placeholder system
- âœ… **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against Discord API rate limits
- âœ… **Async Processing**: Non-blocking webhook delivery
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with automatic retry
- âœ… **Memory Safe**: Proper resource cleanup and queue management

## Setup Guide

### 1. Create Discord Webhook
1. Go to your Discord server
2. Navigate to: Server Settings â†’ Integrations â†’ Webhooks
3. Click "Create Webhook" or "New Webhook"
4. Choose the channel where logs should be sent
5. Copy the webhook URL
6. (Optional) Customize the webhook name and avatar

### 2. Configure SmartSpawner
Open `config.yml` and find the `logging.discord` section:

```yaml
logging:
  discord:
    enabled: true  # Enable Discord logging
    webhook_url: "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE"  # Paste your webhook URL
    show_player_head: true  # Show player avatars
```

### 3. Choose Events to Log
Configure which events should be sent to Discord:

```yaml
discord:
  log_all_events: false  # Set to true to log everything
  logged_events:
    - COMMAND_EXECUTE_PLAYER
    - COMMAND_EXECUTE_CONSOLE
    - SPAWNER_PLACE
    - SPAWNER_BREAK
    # Add more events as needed
```

## Configuration

### Embed Customization

#### Title
```yaml
embed:
  title: "ðŸ”” Spawner Action Log"
```

#### Description
```yaml
embed:
  description: "{description}"  # Uses event description
  # Or custom: "{player} performed {description} at {location}"
```

#### Footer
```yaml
embed:
  footer: "SmartSpawner Logger"
```

### Color Scheme
Colors are in hexadecimal format (without #):

```yaml
embed:
  colors:
    COMMAND: "5865F2"   # Blurple for commands
    PLACE: "57F287"     # Green for placements
    BREAK: "ED4245"     # Red for breaks/explosions
    STACK: "FEE75C"     # Yellow for stacking
    DEFAULT: "5865F2"   # Default color
```

You can also set colors for specific events:
```yaml
colors:
  SPAWNER_PLACE: "57F287"
  SPAWNER_BREAK: "ED4245"
  COMMAND_EXECUTE_PLAYER: "5865F2"
```

### Custom Fields
Add custom fields to embeds:

```yaml
embed:
  fields:
    - name: "Server"
      value: "Production"
      inline: true
    - name: "Action Time"
      value: "{time}"
      inline: false
```

## Placeholders

Available placeholders for customization:

| Placeholder | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `{description}` | Event description | "Spawner placed" |
| `{event_type}` | Event type name | "SPAWNER_PLACE" |
| `{player}` | Player name | "Steve" |
| `{player_uuid}` | Player UUID | "069a79f4-..." |
| `{world}` | World name | "world" |
| `{x}`, `{y}`, `{z}` | Coordinates | "100", "64", "200" |
| `{location}` | Full location | "world (100, 64, 200)" |
| `{entity}` | Entity type | "PIG" |
| `{time}` | Timestamp | "2025-01-15 14:30:00" |
| `{command}` | Command name (for command events) | "give" |
| `{full_command}` | Full command (for command events) | "/ss give spawner..." |

Plus any custom metadata fields from the specific log entry.

## Event Types

- `SPAWNER_BREAK` - Spawner broken
- `SPAWNER_EXPLODE` - Spawner destroyed by explosion

### Spawner Stacking
- `SPAWNER_STACK_HAND` - Spawner stacked by hand
- `SPAWNER_STACK_GUI` - Spawner stacked via GUI
- `SPAWNER_DESTACK_GUI` - Spawner destacked via GUI

### GUI Interactions

- `SPAWNER_ITEM_FILTER` - Filter toggled
- `SPAWNER_DROP_PAGE_ITEMS` - Page items dropped

### Other
- `SPAWNER_EGG_CHANGE` - Entity type changed

## Rate Limiting

The system automatically handles Discord's rate limits:
- Maximum 25 requests per minute (safe buffer)
- Automatic queue management
- Warning when queue backs up
- Graceful degradation under load

## Best Practices

### Performance
1. **Don't log everything to Discord** - Choose important events only
2. **Use file logging for detailed audit** - Discord for notifications
3. **Monitor queue size** - Check logs for backup warnings

### Security
1. **Keep webhook URL secret** - Don't share publicly
2. **Use appropriate channel permissions** - Limit who can see logs
3. **Regularly rotate webhooks** - If compromised

### Maintenance
1. **Test configuration changes** - Use test server first
2. **Monitor webhook health** - Check Discord for delivery
3. **Review logs periodically** - Ensure proper logging

## Troubleshooting

### Webhooks Not Sending
1. Check `enabled: true` in config
2. Verify webhook URL is correct
3. Check console for errors
4. Ensure Discord channel exists
5. Verify webhook hasn't been deleted

### Rate Limit Warnings
1. Reduce logged events
2. Increase processing interval
3. Use file logging for high-volume events

### Missing Information
1. Check placeholder syntax `{placeholder}`
2. Verify event includes that data
3. Review console for errors

### Player Heads Not Showing
1. Check `show_player_head: true`
2. Ensure player has a valid username
3. Verify Mineatar service is accessible

## Example Configurations

### Minimal Setup (Commands Only)
```yaml
discord:
  enabled: true
  webhook_url: "YOUR_URL"
  logged_events:
    - COMMAND_EXECUTE_PLAYER
    - COMMAND_EXECUTE_CONSOLE
```

### Audit Trail (All Major Events)
```yaml
discord:
  enabled: true
  webhook_url: "YOUR_URL"
  logged_events:
    - SPAWNER_PLACE
    - SPAWNER_BREAK
    - SPAWNER_EXPLODE
    - COMMAND_EXECUTE_PLAYER
    - COMMAND_EXECUTE_CONSOLE
    - SPAWNER_STACK_GUI
    - SPAWNER_DESTACK_GUI
```

### Full Monitoring
```yaml
discord:
  enabled: true
  webhook_url: "YOUR_URL"
  log_all_events: true  # Log everything
```

## Memory Leak Prevention

The implementation includes several safeguards:
1. **Bounded Queues**: ConcurrentLinkedQueue with monitoring
2. **Resource Cleanup**: Proper connection closure
3. **Task Cancellation**: Clean shutdown handling
4. **Thread Safety**: ThreadLocal for date formatting
5. **Limited Flush**: Max 10 entries on shutdown

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Async webhook processing (non-blocking)
- Separate queue from file logging
- Rate limiting with atomic counters
- Graceful degradation under load

### HTTP Implementation
- 5-second connection timeout
- 5-second read timeout
- Proper error handling
- Automatic retry from queue

### Thread Safety
- ConcurrentLinkedQueue for thread-safe operations
- AtomicBoolean for shutdown flag
- AtomicLong for rate limit counters
- ThreadLocal for SimpleDateFormat

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check console logs for errors
2. Verify configuration syntax
3. Test with minimal config
4. Report issues on GitHub with logs
